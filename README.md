An intelligent search system for space research articles, powered by FAISS vector embeddings and semantic search technology. SpaceLifeTeam helps researchers, students, and space enthusiasts discover relevant scientific literature efficiently.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Semantic Search**: Uses FAISS vector embeddings for intelligent document retrieval
- **Smart Deduplication**: Automatically removes duplicate articles from search results
- **Relevant Excerpts**: Extracts and displays the most relevant passages from each document
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clean, intuitive Streamlit-based UI
- **Fast & Efficient**: Cached embeddings for quick response times
- **Batch Processing**: Automated pipeline for processing large datasets of research articles

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The project consists of two main components:

### 1. Data Pipeline (`pipeline_transform.py`)
- Extracts articles from CSV containing publication links
- Downloads and caches documents from web sources
- Splits documents into manageable chunks
- Generates embeddings using HuggingFace models
- Creates and saves FAISS vector store

### 2. Search Interface (`streamlit.py`)
- Streamlit web application
- Real-time semantic search
- Smart result ranking and deduplication
- Interactive document exploration

### üéØ Next Steps
We're continuously improving SpaceLifeTeam! 

Here's what's coming next:
